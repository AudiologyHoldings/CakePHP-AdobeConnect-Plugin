h1. Adobe Connect Datasource+Models Plugin for CakePHP

* "Adobe Connect":http://www.adobe.com/products/adobeconnect.html (version 7.5 tested)
* "CakePHP":http://cakephp.org (version 1.3 tested)

This CakePHP Plugin uses the "Adobe Connect API":http://help.adobe.com/en_US/AcrobatConnectPro/7.5/WebServices/ 
as a Datasouce and packages access to it's parts as isolated Models.

* *AdobeConnectPrincipal* - access to all Principals: users & groups
* *AdobeConnectSco* - access to all SCO items: meetings, content, folders, etc.
* *AdobeConnectReport* - access to all Reporting functions: meetings, content, folders, etc.

The API interaction and standard "heavy-lifting" is done in the Datasource, but the Models tie the peices together and facilitate access through normal commands and syntax.

See the unit tests for more information on how to use.
